# npl
Normative Programming Language (NPL) is a language to program the norms of multi-agent systems. 
There are some papers describing the language in the folder [publications](https://github.com/jomifred/npl/tree/master/doc/publications). 

The folder [examples/npl](https://github.com/jomifred/npl/tree/master/examples/npl) illustrates its use in Java.

This language is used to implement the organisational platform for [Moise](http://moise.sf.net), called _ORA4MAS_, 
that is integrated into the [JaCaMo](http://jacamo.sf.net) project.
